## üõ†Ô∏è Production-Grade Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
1. Data Annotation
We used Roboflow as our data annotation platform. In particular, Polygonal annotation is used to annotate the tower structure and Bounding box annotation is used for defects(cracks and rust).

3.  Since YOLOv8 requires different data formats for object detection and segmentation tasks, we wrote a custom Python script on Google Colab to programmatically separate the labeled dataset into two subsets, one for object detection using bounding box labels and one for segmentation using polygon annotations.

4. Image Processing( 2x2 tiling, Images resizing, Auto-Orientation)
5. Image Augmentation

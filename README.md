## üõ†Ô∏è Production-Grade Implementation

### Data Preprocessing
1. Data Annotation
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc9b3e4e-28d3-4de3-b0f2-1f647ef4701e)
2.  Since YOLOv8 requires different data formats for object detection and segmentation tasks, we wrote a custom Python script on Google Colab to programmatically separate the labeled dataset into two subsets:
 ‚Ä¢ A dataset formatted specifically for object detection using bounding box labels.
 ‚Ä¢ A separate dataset was prepared for segmentation using polygon annotations.  
3. Image Processing( 2x2 tiling, Images resizing, Auto-Orientation)
4. Image Augmentation

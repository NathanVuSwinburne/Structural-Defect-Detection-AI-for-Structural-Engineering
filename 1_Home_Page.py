    ### 📋 Project Overview
    This AI system detects structural defects from image data to assist in maintenance and inspection of infrastructure.
    The model can identify various types of structural flaws including cracks, corrosion, and other defects that
    may compromise structural integrity.

    ### 🎯 Key Objectives
    - Develop a deep learning model to recognize structural flaws in photos with high accuracy
    - Enable confident identification of defect types (rust, cracks, etc.)
    - Improve automation of structural inspections
    - Reduce maintenance costs and increase safety through early detection

    ### 💡 Key Features
    - Multi-class defect classification
    - Support for image, video, and real-time analysis
    - High-resolution drone photography compatibility
    - Confidence scoring for detected defects

### Navigation Instructions

This application offers three different ways to detect structural defects:

1. **🖼️ Image Analysis**
   - Navigate to the "Image Prediction" page in the sidebar
   - Upload your structural images
   - Get instant analysis of potential defects

2. **🎬 Video Analysis**
   - Select the "Video Prediction" page
   - Upload video footage of structures
   - Receive frame-by-frame defect detection

3. **📹 Webcam Analysis**
   - Go to the "Webcam Prediction" page
   - Enable your camera when prompted
   - Point your camera at structures for real-time analysis

Select your preferred method from the sidebar navigation menu above ☝️

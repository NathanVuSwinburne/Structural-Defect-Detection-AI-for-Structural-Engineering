## Model 1: YoloV8-Medium for Crack Detection (bbox.pt)

This model is trained on a custom dataset of structural defect images to detect cracks and other defects using bounding boxes. It uses the YOLOv8-medium architecture optimized for real-time detection.

### Download Instructions

1. Download the model from [YOLOv8 Crack Detection Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzMvNrrZJIXPYJV1y6qoKMEHSGa99y1z/view?usp=sharing)
2. Rename the downloaded file to `bbox.pt`
3. Place it in this `models/` directory

## Model 2: YoloV8-Medium-Segmentation for Tower Detection (segment.pt)

This model performs semantic segmentation to identify and outline tower structures in images. It is based on YOLOv8-medium-seg architecture and trained on tower infrastructure datasets.

### Download Instructions

1. Download the model from [YOLOv8 Tower Segmentation Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MR5Vls76tdoWXPlngE3ADvPYQM3laBi0/view?usp=sharing)
2. Rename the downloaded file to `segment.pt`
3. Place it in this `models/` directory
